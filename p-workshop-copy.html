            <p><strong>Designing for Everyday Care in Communities</strong></p>
            <p>Austin Toombs, Andy Dow, John Vines, Colin Gray, Barbara Dennis, Rachel Clarke, and Ann Light </p>
            <p>Recent HCI scholarship has begun to incorporate the concept of care as an alternative design lens, moving beyond health care or social care to consider care as a fundamental relational quality of life. This one-day workshop brings together researchers to find a shared understanding of the ways in which interpersonal care and interdependence could be supported through technology design in community contexts. The goal is to raise issues and increase sensitivity towards care, with the ultimate aim of impacting design practices—including how one might design community interactions with and for care. Participants will learn together how such a focus could impact their own research, while mapping and articulating how research and design in HCI-related fields can and does integrate care into sociotechnical systems more broadly.</p>

            <p><strong>Manipulating Reality? Designing and Deploying Virtual Reality in Sensitive Settings</strong></p>
            <p>Jenny Waycott, Greg Wadley, Steven Baker, Hasan Ferdous, Thuong Hoang, Kathrin Gerling, Christopher Headleand, and Adalberto Simeone  </p>
            <p>Virtual reality (VR) is now being designed and deployed in diverse sensitive settings, especially for therapeutic purposes. For example, VR experiences are used for diversional therapy in aged care and as therapy for people living with conditions such as phobias and post-traumatic stress. While these uses of VR offer great promise, they also present significant challenges. Given the novelty of VR, its immersive nature, and its impact on the user’s sense of reality, it can be particularly challenging to engage participants in co-design and predict what might go wrong when implementing these technologies in sensitive settings. This workshop provides a forum for researchers working in this emerging space to share stories about their experiences of designing and evaluating VR applications in settings such as aged care or mental health therapy. The workshop will develop a manifesto for good practice, outlining co-design strategies and ethical issues to consider when designing and deploying VR in sensitive settings.</p>

            <p><strong>The &#x27;Next Billion Users&#x27;: Designing for Emerging Markets</strong></p>
            <p>Chandrika Cycil, Rajiv Arjan, and Lauren Celenza</p>
            <p>The number of users coming online for the first time on mobile phones in emerging markets is fast growing. As the trajectory of internet use for these users follows a mobile-first experience, technical and infrastructural constraints impact the overall experience. The workshop aims to identify and discuss salient themes surrounding the technology needs of users in emerging markets that include Asia, Africa and South America. Emphasis will be on how researchers and designers understand these unique needs and the new insights and perspectives needed to design for mobile users in emerging markets.</p>

            <p><strong>From Artifacts to Architecture </strong></p>
            <p>Hamed Alavi, Elizabeth Churchill, David Kirk, Henriette Bier, Himanshu Verma, Denis Lalanne, and Holger Schnädelbach </p>
            <p>The vision and mission of research under the banner of Ubiquitous Computing has increasingly moved from focusing on the realm of &quot;artifacts&quot; to the realm of &quot;environments&quot;. We seek to scrutinize this very transition, and raise questions that relate to the specific attributes of built environments that set them inherently apart from artifacts. How does an interactive environment differ from an interactive artifact, a collection of artifacts, or an integrated suite of artifacts? Consequently, we ask what are the new user experience dimensions that HCI researchers should merge into their considerations, for example, by supplementing usability and engagement with occupants&#x27; comfort across multiple dimensions, and shifting attention from (often) short lifespan and discretionary to durable and immersive experiences? In this contribution, we bring arguments from the literature of environmental psychology and architecture that highlight the points of divergence between artifacts and architecture, and then translate them into challenges for Human-Computer Interaction, and particularly for the emerging domain of Human-Building Interaction.</p>

            <p>A diverse set of research and design initiatives related to time, temporality, and slowness has emerged in the DIS and HCI communities. The goals of this workshop are to: 1. bring together researchers to reflect on conceptual, methodological, and practice-based outcomes and issues and 2. to develop an agenda for future research in this growing area. </p>

            <p><strong>Let’s Get Divorced: Constructing Knowledge Outcomes for Critical Design and Constructive Design Research</strong></p>
            <p>Forlizzi, Zimmerman, Hekkert, Koskinen</p>
            <p>Over the last two decades, constructive design research (CDR) — more commonly called Research through Design within HCI — has become an accepted mode of scholarly inquiry within the design research community. It has been described as having three distinct genres: lab, field, and showroom. The lab and field genres typically take a pragmatic stance and typically propose a preferred future. Research done following the showroom approach — more commonly known as critical design (CD), speculative design, or design fictions — typically offers a polemic and a critique of the current state embodied in an artifact. Recently, we have observed a growing conflict within the design research community between pragmatic and critical design researchers [4]. To help reduce this conflict, we called for a divorce between CD and pragmatic CDR, advocating that each approach has its own merits and should be evaluated on its own account. Other design researchers have pushed back on this stance, seeking to create some middle ground to connect these two types of research. In this day-long workshop, we seek to look at exemplar CDR and CD case studies, to develop methods for describing, evaluating, replicating, and making use of knowledge outcomes from these two forms of design research.</p>

            <p><strong>Designing Interactive Systems to Support and Augment Creativity: A Roadmap for Research and Design</strong></p>
            <p>Dalsgaard, Halskov, Frich, Biskjaer, Kerne, Lupfer</p>
            <p>The aims of the workshop are to examine and discuss the current state of research in designing interactive systems to support and augment creative work, and to outline a roadmap for future research initiatives. The workshop will explore methodological issues and approaches, overarching trends and developments, exemplary cases, and future initiatives to study and design systems and tools to augment creative practices. Participation in the workshop requires participants to contribute with a position paper on one of the above topics, and to read and comment on co-participants contributions before the workshop.</p>

            <p><strong>Designing for Effective Interactions with Data in the Internet of Things</strong></p>
            <p>Wolff, Seffah, Kortuem, van der Linden</p>
            <p>The Internet of Things (IoT), a type of cyber-physical system, has led to a drastic growth in the number of devices and sensors connected to each other and to the digital word. This has further led to an exponential increase in the amount of data being produced and disseminated throughout such systems. This data has the potential to provide valuable insights into user behavior that can inform a design process. It also comprises an important aspect of an IoT product or service that an end user might interact to gain actionable insights. For example, when to use energy in the home, how to avoid polluted or flooded areas, or to visit the shops at quiet times. These same users may also be one source of the data that is analysed to provide this intelligence. However, in many case more intelligence is gained by combining different data sets.This raises questions about how to help both designers and end-users to get the most value from the insights acquired through the combination and analysis of IoT data, whilst being sensitive to issues around privacy and security of data contributed by the public. There is currently no clear framework to support designers in navigating through a design process that uses and combines such complex data.The aim of this one day workshop is to explore how to effectively incorporate data into a design process and how to design for more effective interactions between humans and data within IoT technologies. It will also create a roadmap for development of new methods and tools to support responsible, data-driven, co-design of new IoT interactive products and services.</p>

            <p><strong>Handmaking Food Ideals: Crafting the Design of Future Food-related Technologies</strong></p>
            <p>Vannucci, Bertran, Marshall, Wilde</p>
            <p>Much technology is designed to help people enact processes faster and more precisely. Yet, these advantages can come at the cost of other, perhaps less tangible, values. In this workshop we aim to articulate values associated with handmade through a co-creative exploration in the food domain. Our objective is to explore the potential of integrating such values into future food-related technologies. In a full day workshop we will: critically reflect on the notion of handmade; engage actively with food—production, plating and consumption—as design material; and conduct collective discussions around the values that these processes and materials can embody when attended to through lenses other than efficiency. By handmaking: touching, smelling, tasting, listening, speaking and enacting choreographies with the materials at hand, we hope to deepen the discussion of the meaning associated with the handmade and bring a richness to ways that designers imagine future food-related technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Designing within Connected Systems</strong></p>
            <p>Funk, Hengeveld</p>
            <p>In this two-day workshop, we investigate how to design in the context of distributed, networked interfaces, dynamic input-output mappings and emergent aesthetics. With this workshop, we aim to complement the theoretical discussion of positions provided by the participants with the hands-on activity of designing and building a networked group interface for music manipulation using Leap Motion® controllers. Participants engage in a two-stage design process, the first focused on designing individual music controllers and the second on using these in a networked format. We conclude the workshop with a reflection and discussion of what was achieved at both theoretical and experiential levels, and project a roadmap of future activities together.</p>
