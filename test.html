      <h1>DIVERSITY AND DESIGN </h1>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The theme of DIS 2018 is diversity and design. Diversity is reflected in the choice of Hong Kong as the site of the DIS 2018 conference. Hong Kong’s 7.5 million people come from different ethnic, social and cultural backgrounds to form a multiplicity of communities, beliefs, and practices. Just like any designs, interactive systems can be designed to take into account diversity, but also the universal landscape as the recent success of many Silicon Valley companies so clearly show. When faced with diversity, designers face a classic philosophical question about particulars and universals: should design build on diversity and be particular, or should it go after universal applications, technologies and experiences? Every designer has to find a way around this question in defining their view of experience, methods, applications and technologies. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2>CALL FOR PARTICIPATION </h2>
      <p> </p>
      <p>ACM SIGCHI Designing Interactive Systems conference 2018</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>DIS 2018 invites submissions that address the following questions: Are our current models of user experience adequate in addressing diversity? What kinds of methods and processes are needed for designing for diversity? How can applications and technologies be designed to address diversity and even add to it in this era of giant global corporations? What are the ethical limits designers have to face when designing for diversity?</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>·
        <strong>Design
theory, methods, and critical perspectives</strong><strong>:</strong> </p>
      <p><strong> </strong></p>
      <p><em>Do
our design methods, processes and critical perspectives support diversity - and
should they?</em> - Your answer to this question can focus on methods, tools, and techniques for engaging people; researching, designing, and co-designing interactive systems; participatory design, design artifacts, research through design; documenting and reflecting on design processes etc.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>·
        <strong>Experience</strong>: </p>
      <p><strong> </strong></p>
      <p><em>Are our current models of user experience adequate in addressing
diversity – or it is better to go universal?</em> - Your answer to this question may focus on places, temporality, people, communities, events, phenomena, aesthetics, user experience, usability, engagement, empowerment, wellbeing, designing things that matter, diversity, participation, materiality, making, etc. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>·
        <strong>Application Domains</strong>: </p>
      <p><em>How to design applications that take into account diversity – or should
we design universal applications?</em> - An answer to this question may focus on health, ICT4D, children-computer interaction, sustainability, games/entertainment computing, digital arts, etc.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>·
        <strong>Technological Innovation</strong>: </p>
      <p><strong> </strong></p>
      <p><em>When designing systems, tools, and artifacts, should we design for
particular situations and communities or go global?</em> - When answering this question, you can look at sensors and actuators, mobile devices, multi touch and touchless interaction, social media, personal, community, public displays etc.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>We welcome and encourage theoretical contributions to DIS 2018. Rather than its own subcommittee, please consider submitting theory contributions to any of the above four subcommittees.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Papers and Notes accepted for presentation at DIS 2018 are published by the ACM in the <a href="http://dl.acm.org">ACM Digital
Library</a> and have in the past attracted high impact, visibility and citations.
      </p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2>Authors take note </h2>
      <p><strong> </strong></p>
      <p>The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to <em>two weeks prior</em> to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library <em>after</em> the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)</p>
