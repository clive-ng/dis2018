        <h1>DIVERSITY AND DESIGN </h1>
        <p>How should we take diversity into account when designing interactive systems?</p>
        <p>The theme of DIS 2018 is diversity and design. Diversity is reflected in the choice of Hong Kong as the site of the DIS 2018 conference. Hong Kong’s 7.5 million people come from different ethnic, social and cultural backgrounds to form a multiplicity of communities, beliefs, and practices. Just like any designs, interactive systems can be designed to take into account diversity, but also the universal landscape as the recent success of many Silicon Valley companies so clearly show. When faced with diversity, designers face a classic philosophical question about particulars and universals: should design build on diversity and be particular, or should it go after universal applications, technologies and experiences? Every designer has to find a way around this question in defining their view of experience, methods, applications and technologies.<br></p>
        <p>DIS is an interdisciplinary conference that encompasses how such systems are built, introduced and employed in a wide variety of socio-cultural contexts. DIS 2018 invites several types of submissions, including papers, pictorials, demos, provocations and workshops. As before, the conference focuses explicitly on the <strong>design aspects
</strong>of interactive systems, products, services, and spaces. <br></p>
        <p>DIS 2018 is hosted by the School of Design of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.<br></p>
        <h2>Call for Participation</h2>
        <p><strong>ACM
SIGCHI Designing Interactive Systems conference 2018</strong></p>
        <p>DIS 2018 invites submissions that address the following questions: Are our current models of user experience adequate in addressing diversity? What kinds of methods and processes are needed for designing for diversity? How can applications and technologies be designed to address diversity and even add to it in this era of giant global corporations? What are the ethical limits designers have to face when designing for diversity? </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Design
theory, methods, and critical perspectives</strong><strong>:<br></strong><em>Do our design methods, processes and
critical perspectives support diversity? What are their limits and should they?</em> - Your answer to this question can focus on methods, tools, and techniques for engaging people; researching, designing, and co-designing interactive systems; participatory design, design artifacts, research through design; documenting and reflecting on design processes etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Experience</strong>: <br><em>Are our current
models of user experience adequate in addressing diversity – or it is better to
go universal?</em> - Your answer to this question may focus on places, temporality, people, communities, events, phenomena, aesthetics, user experience, usability, engagement, empowerment, wellbeing, designing things that matter, diversity, participation, materiality, making, etc.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Application Domains: <br></strong><em>How to design
applications that take into account diversity – or should we design universal
applications?</em> - An answer to this question may focus on health, ICT4D, children-computer interaction, sustainability, games/entertainment computing, digital arts, etc.</li>
          <li><strong>Technological Innovation:</strong> <br>When designing systems, tools, and artifacts, should we design for particular situations and communities or go global? – This subcommittee is interested in sensors and actuators, mobile devices, multi touch and touchless interaction, social media, personal, community-based, and public displays, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Papers and Notes accepted for presentation at DIS 2018 are published by the ACM in the <a href="http://dl.acm.org">ACM Digital
Library</a> and have in the past attracted high impact, visibility and citations.</h5>
        <h2><strong>Authors take note </strong></h2>
        <h5>The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to <em>two weeks prior</em> to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library <em>after</em> the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)</h5>
        <h2>Preparing and Submitting Your Paper of Note</h2>
        <p>All submissions should be anonymous and submitted via the <a href="https://precisionconference.com/~sigchi">PCS submission system</a>.</p>
        <h2>Formatting and Length</h2>
        <p>All submissions should be formatted using the <a href="https://sigchi.org/templates/">SIGCHI Conference Publications
Format</a>. Please use the most recent SIGCHI Papers template in either Word or LaTeX format. Papers should be no longer than 10 pages, while Notes should be no longer than 4 pages. This includes all figures, tables, appendices, and an abstract of less than 150 words. References do not count towards the page limits. Submissions that are over the required length will be rejected.</p>
        <p>All Papers and Notes must present original, unpublished research. Papers and Notes are not allowed to be under concurrent review with other conferences, journals, or venues.</p>
        <p>When considering whether to write a Paper or Note, please think about the breadth of contribution that your work presents to the field. Both Papers and Notes should be substantial contributions. A Paper allows authors with particularly novel or high-impact work to outline new approaches, philosophies, or findings in greater depth. A Note allows work that is significant and novel but incremental to be added to the field.</p>
        <p>References are not included in the total page limit.</p>
        <h2>Anonymity </h2>
        <p>Both Papers and Notes should be anonymized for blind peer review. Authors are expected to remove author and institutional identity from the title and header of the paper, as well as any information embedded within the meta-data of the submission file.</p>
        <p>Suppression of identity in the body of the paper is left up to the discretion of authors. However, reviewers must be able to compare your current submission to other related work in the area. In many situations, this is the author’s own work found in other papers.</p>
        <p>If you are citing your own work, we ask you refer to it in the third person as opposed to removing it completely because of blind review. For example, rather than stating, “This study builds on our prior work [removed for anonymity],” please refer to it in the third person, such as, “This study builds on prior work by &lt;authors, where=&quot;&quot; you=&quot;&quot; list=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot; names=&quot;&quot;&gt; [2].”&lt;/authors,&gt;
        </p>
        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <h5>Submission deadline is 8 Jan 2018 at 23:59 PST.
        </h5>
        <h5> As part of the submission process, authors must submit an abstract, keywords, and meta-data related to the submission’s contents. Authors will also be asked to select a ranked list of between one and three subcommittees that fit their paper.</h5>
        <h5> Subcommittees include the following:</h5>
        <h5>Design theory, methods, and critical perspectives ExperienceApplication DomainsTechnological Innovation (systems, tools, and/or artifact designs)</h5>
        <h5>Details for each theme are listed above in the Call for Papers. Theme selection will be used to assign your Paper or Note to one of the review subcommittees.</h5>

        <h2>Review Process</h2>
        <p>Papers and Notes follow a rigorous blind peer review process. This process is managed by the Technical Program Chairs (TPC), the Subcommittee Chairs (SCs) for each theme, and Associate Chairs (ACs). Confidentiality of submissions is maintained throughout the review process.
        </p>
        <h2>Upon Acceptance of Your Paper or Note</h2>
        <p>Authors will be notified of conditional acceptance or rejection of their Paper or Note on 5 March 2018. Meta reviews will describe any further changes that the authors are expected to make to the paper prior to its publication. These should be made as part of a “camera ready submission” into PCS by the deadline of 28 March 2018. Final changes will be checked by members of the program committee prior to making a final acceptance of the paper. If authors are unable to meet the requirements for changes, the program chairs will be notified and may reject the paper.</p>
        <p>All accepted submissions require a signed form assigning copyright or license to the ACM, or an upfront fee to ACM to enable Open Access. Responsibility for obtaining permissions to use video, audio, or pictures of identifiable people or proprietary content rests with the author, not the ACM or the DIS conference.</p>
        <p>At least one author of each accepted paper must be registered for the conference. If the person presenting the Paper or Note is a first-author student, a student registration fee has to be paid.</p>
        <p>All published papers will appear online in the <a href="http://dl.acm.org">ACM Digital Library</a> and be distributed digitally to conference delegates as part of the conference proceedings.</p>
        <p>At the conference, authors of accepted papers must be in attendance to present their papers and answer questions from the audience. Presenters of Papers have a 20-minute slot including questions, and presenters of Notes have a 10-minute slot including questions. Papers and Notes whose authors are not at the conference to present may be removed from the ACM Digital Library and the conference proceedings.</p>

                <br><em><strong>A - Clear rejects:</strong></em> <br>if a paper is below acceptance threshold (it is calculated after all reviews are in, but 3.2 is a good approximation), the paper is rejected. Only 1AC metareview is needed.<br>
                <br>
                <strong><em>B - Clear Accepts:</em></strong> <br>if a paper is a clear accept (usually above 4.0), 1AC can recommend accepting the paper. Only 1AC meta-review is needed.<br>
                <br>
                <em><strong>C - Borderline</strong></em>: <br>2AC writes a second meta-review if a paper is in the possible acceptance range<br>
                <br>
                <strong><em>D -  Papers with large standard </em></strong><strong><em>deviation:</em></strong><br> 2AC writes second meta-review in case of conflicting reviews.

        <h2>Upon Acceptance of Your Paper or Note</h2>
        <p>Authors will be notified of conditional acceptance or rejection of their Paper or Note on 5 March 2018. Meta reviews will describe any further changes that the authors are expected to make to the paper prior to its publication. These should be made as part of a “camera ready submission” into PCS by the deadline of 28 March 2018. Final changes will be checked by members of the program committee prior to making a final acceptance of the paper. If authors are unable to meet the requirements for changes, the program chairs will be notified and may reject the paper.</p>
        <p>All accepted submissions require a signed form assigning copyright or license to the ACM, or an upfront fee to ACM to enable Open Access. Responsibility for obtaining permissions to use video, audio, or pictures of identifiable people or proprietary content rests with the author, not the ACM or the DIS conference.</p>
        <p>At least one author of each accepted paper must be registered for the conference. If the person presenting the Paper or Note is a first-author student, a student registration fee has to be paid.</p>
        <p>All published papers will appear online in the <a href="http://dl.acm.org">ACM Digital Library</a> and be distributed digitally to conference delegates as part of the conference proceedings.</p>
        <p>At the conference, authors of accepted papers must be in attendance to present their papers and answer questions from the audience. Presenters of Papers have a 20-minute slot including questions, and presenters of Notes have a 10-minute slot including questions. Papers and Notes whose authors are not at the conference to present may be removed from the ACM Digital Library and the conference proceedings.</p>
